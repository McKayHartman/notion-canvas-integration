Make sure to replicate all commands exactly as you see them below.

In this last step you need to prove to me that you have done the above steps without a hitch. You are asked to ssh into \"github.com\" as a user \"git\". Keep in mind that this is only done for the purpose of showing that you have installed your ssh keys correctly, otherwise you would never do this in your day to day operation. Check the output that you receive as a response from GitHub when you try to ssh into it. It will tell you whether you authenticated correctly or not.

As you saw from the material that you have watched, this workflow is really a circle with an overlap. If this idea does not ring a bell, you have to (really, really) go back to the video that covered this concept, please <a class=\"inline_disabled\" href=\"https://youtu.be/ygqx50-JHEE\" target=\"_blank\">click here</a>.</p>\n<p>For your reference, here is the schema again that I developed that distills the gist of that workflow:</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><img id=\"10073067\" src=\"https://canvas.nau.edu/courses/35850/files/10992807/preview?verifier=4cToeDeNeaiQN100F1i7k76V6Vo8ns9CibAHJZRH\" alt=\"GitHub Basic Workflow.jpg\" data-api-endpoint=\"https://canvas.nau.edu/api/v1/courses/35850/files/10992807\" data-api-returntype=\"File\"></p>\n<p>The (only) focus of this assignment is to familiarize you with the basic GitHub workflow cycle and go through it twice. For clarity, you won't contribute to a repo that you share with others - yet. The latter will be the goal of the last and final assignment that comes next, which will conclude this module overall.</p>\n<p>In order to successfully finish this assignment, you need to have done the first assignment \"Configure GitHub SSH\", which is setting up SSH on GitHub, so that you don't need to keep putting in your credentials when interacting with the GitHub server. If you find yourself being prompted for your credentials when you clone, pull or push, that part went wrong and you will want to revisit that assignment.</p>\n<h2>Follow Along - Let's get Warmed up!</h2>\n<p>This first part is intended to warm you up with the workflow, so that you have it done once, before you are on your own.&nbsp;</p>\n<h4><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Step 1 - Preparation</span></h4>\n<p>Let's create a quick repo on GitHub so that we have something to work with. Do the following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Head over to GitHub. Click on your avatar in the upper right corner and then on \"Your repositories.</li>\n<li>Click the green \"New\" button in the upper right.</li>\n<li>Name your repo \"hello-world\" and click on \"Create repository\".</li>\n<li>Find the link that says \"creating a new file\" and click on it.</li>\n<li>Enter the famous \"hello world\" program like so:</li>\n</ul>\n<p><img id=\"10076066\" src=\"https://canvas.nau.edu/courses/35850/files/10992801/preview?verifier=lwUFkx2jamqhiHQeiiqXaJjokZN7OpzZedVRl81v\" alt=\"helloworld.png\" data-api-endpoint=\"https://canvas.nau.edu/api/v1/courses/35850/files/10992801\" data-api-returntype=\"File\"></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Give that file a name, i.e. <code>helloworld.c</code>. You should see something like that:</li>\n</ul>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><img id=\"10076120\" src=\"https://canvas.nau.edu/courses/35850/files/10992800/preview?verifier=83vhoWp9TTRwoECSmqY6zC3nQRWlxcm84SBmnYGC\" alt=\"helloworld code.png\" data-api-endpoint=\"https://canvas.nau.edu/api/v1/courses/35850/files/10992800\" data-api-returntype=\"File\"></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Click on the green button \"Commit changes ...\", enter a commit message of your choice or just go with what is offered and click on \"Commit changes\" - and you are done with this prep.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Step 2 - Cloning the repo and creating your own branch</span></h4>\n<p><span>Log into your Ubuntu platform. If you have not already done so, please install Git - Follow the instructions given in chapter 1.5 - 1.8 of PG, see <a class=\"inline_disabled\" href=\"https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Clone your repo - see the <span style=\"color: #169179; text-decoration: underline;\">green step 1</span> in my schema</span></p>\n<p>Create a folder where your repo is going to live, you will probably name it <code>helloworld</code>. Change into that folder.</p>\n<p>Now clone your <code>hello-world</code> repo that you have on GitHub. This is the first step in green that you see on my schema. You will wonder where you will get that link from, that is passed in: <code>git clone &lt;remote&gt;:&lt;user&gt;/&lt;repo&gt;</code>. Well, you don't need to construct that link manually, it's easy to retrieve from the GitHub server. Click on &lt;Code&gt; in the upper left:</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><img id=\"10076263\" src=\"https://canvas.nau.edu/courses/35850/files/10992803/preview?verifier=kZtrD8q9fLplnvoKe0vN8aZR2E5cZeg4m7kai7Pa\" alt=\"helloworld ssh link 1.png\" data-api-endpoint=\"https://canvas.nau.edu/api/v1/courses/35850/files/10992803\" data-api-returntype=\"File\"></p>\n<p>&nbsp;Then click on the green button \"Code\" and immediately on \"SSH\" - DON'T click on \"HTTPS\", make sure to really click on \"SSH\":</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><img id=\"10076260\" src=\"https://canvas.nau.edu/courses/35850/files/10992802/preview?verifier=PkSBLJzM80qHwHuXdz9aZgzUcSJJZnjI4SrqU8s9\" alt=\"helloworld ssh link 2.png\" data-api-endpoint=\"https://canvas.nau.edu/api/v1/courses/35850/files/10992802\" data-api-returntype=\"File\"></p>\n<p>Now copy the link by clicking on that little clipboard symbol to the right of the link, in my case that is <code><a href=\"mailto:git@github.com:dieterotte/hello-world.git\" target=\"_blank\">git@github.com:dieterotte/hello-world.git</a></code></p>\n<p>Head over to your Ubuntu platform and issue the git clone command, you should see something like that:</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><img id=\"10076341\" src=\"https://canvas.nau.edu/courses/35850/files/10992804/preview?verifier=j3EBj8q4q617NmugOvyTssiqck9ICNBQpTY5mvWP\" alt=\"git clone.png\" data-api-endpoint=\"https://canvas.nau.edu/api/v1/courses/35850/files/10992804\" data-api-returntype=\"File\"></p>\n<p>Note that your credentials should not be asked for! Congratulations, you just cloned your first repo!</p>\n<p><strong></strong><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Create a branch - see the <span style=\"color: #169179; text-decoration: underline;\">green step 2</span> in my schema</span></p>\n<p>Not let's prepare for doing some changes to your repo. For that to happen, you will NOT apply your changes to your <span>&nbsp;</span><code>main</code><span>&nbsp;</span>&nbsp;branch directly. Instead, you will create a branch, in which you will do your changes and then propose those changes to be merged into the <span>&nbsp;</span><code>main</code><span>&nbsp;</span>&nbsp;branch by way of a \"pull request\". But first things first, create a branch called <code>helloworld</code>:</p>\n<p><img id=\"10076430\" src=\"https://canvas.nau.edu/courses/35850/files/10992805/preview?verifier=2Hh4Jn4PkyHFpZQTLSLKAAxmKMcaz8kaRV6v8ryi\" alt=\"git checkout -b.png\" data-api-endpoint=\"https://canvas.nau.edu/api/v1/courses/35850/files/10992805\" data-api-returntype=\"File\"></p>\n<p>This concludes the two (green) steps that are specific to setting up a repo on your remote platform, i.e. your Ubuntu server for the first time.</p>\n<p>The following steps you will go over and over again in a normal, \"warmed up\" phase of your project. These are the steps 1 through 6 that you see in red in my schema above. Let's dive into that ...</p>\n<h4><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Step 3 - Applying changes to your code base</span></h4>\n<p>Just for your orientation, have a look at my schema above: you are in the lower right corner. And you are ready to apply changes to your code base, which will involve:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Doing a change in the work tree,</li>\n<li>Staging the change,</li>\n<li>Committing the change ...</li>\n<li>and do the whole thing all over again</li>\n</ul>\n<p>This is the <span style=\"color: #ff0000;\">red step 1</span> in my schema. In CS205 you have learned how to do all that, so we won't cover it again here. If you are shaky with that, you will want to go back, specifically revisit chapters 2 and 3 of the PG text, see <a class=\"inline_disabled\" href=\"https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Basics-Getting-a-Git-Repository\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>.</p>\n<p>Go ahead and add a comment of your choice to your <code>helloworld.c</code> file, then stage and commit the change. Have a look at the git log and understand why there are two commits:</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><img id=\"10076612\" src=\"https://canvas.nau.edu/courses/35850/files/10992806/preview?verifier=dsk2m8zQ0urmqGI7aQk3ZIUeVM2wcfl03IcvU9xS\" alt=\"git add commit.png\" data-api-endpoint=\"https://canvas.nau.edu/api/v1/courses/35850/files/10992806\" data-api-returntype=\"File\"></p>\n<p>The next step is to merge your change into the <span>&nbsp;</span><code>main</code><span>&nbsp;</span>&nbsp;branch on GitHub. This involves two activities:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>You need to push your change unto the GitHub server. The effect of that is that the change in your branch <code>helloworld</code> on your Ubuntu machine is reflected in your branch <code>helloworld</code> on the GitHub server. This is the <span style=\"color: #ff0000;\">red step 2</span> in my schema:</li>\n</ul>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><img id=\"10076733\" src=\"https://canvas.nau.edu/courses/35850/files/10992808/preview?verifier=IoxpKQAuFp3wRmBLDlrsU8yrgCvTpAP2eTSEr3lk\" alt=\"git push 1.png\" data-api-endpoint=\"https://canvas.nau.edu/api/v1/courses/35850/files/10992808\" data-api-returntype=\"File\"></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\">Go ahed and do this step.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>... and you need to create a pull request on the GitHub server. It is called \"pull request\", because you ask for \"pulling\" your changes into the <span>&nbsp;</span><code>main</code><span>&nbsp;</span>&nbsp;branch. The pull request will be evaluated by the repo OWNER - in this case you! Keep that in mind, as it will help you to understand what is going on in the next assignment, when you will be a COLLABORATOR, but not the OWNER ... or the other way around! Once the pull request was okay-ed, your change will be merged into the <code>main</code> branch. Both the pull request and the merge are reflected in the <span style=\"color: #ff0000;\">red step 3</span> in my schema.</li>\n</ul>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\">Now let's do the pull request first. Go to your GitHub server and click on the green \"Compare and pull request\":</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><img id=\"10077200\" src=\"https://canvas.nau.edu/courses/35850/files/10992809/preview?verifier=eI8MMEwkti9wxyLtTy2WFRHsykhUlF4reOX5Yqcs\" alt=\"pull request.png\" data-api-endpoint=\"https://canvas.nau.edu/api/v1/courses/35850/files/10992809\" data-api-returntype=\"File\"></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\">This step allows you to look at the changes that were applied, before you actually issue the pull request:</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><img id=\"10077278\" src=\"https://canvas.nau.edu/courses/35850/files/10992810/preview?verifier=dWdGO87JDRgyzEySEfu2ueAPo7flg2hb5AUUKA6j\" alt=\"pull request 2.png\" data-api-endpoint=\"https://canvas.nau.edu/api/v1/courses/35850/files/10992810\" data-api-returntype=\"File\"></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\">Go ahead and click on the green \"Create pull request\" button, which now allows for discussing the changes. The discussion may trigger more changes that can be added to the pull request - we won't do that here. Finally, the owner may merge the changes into the <span>&nbsp;</span><code>main</code><span>&nbsp;</span> branch OR close the pull request, which will cancel the whole request. That means that the changes were not accepted. Let's go ahead and merge the changes by clicking on the green \"Merge pull request\" button:</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><img id=\"10077360\" src=\"https://canvas.nau.edu/courses/35850/files/10992812/preview?verifier=AJP0bvsemFdgXNQLQMJ9FscQHjadylLlR8hNzOgJ\" alt=\"pull request 3.png\" data-api-endpoint=\"https://canvas.nau.edu/api/v1/courses/35850/files/10992812\" data-api-returntype=\"File\"></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\">You need to confirm the merge:</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><img id=\"10077379\" src=\"https://canvas.nau.edu/courses/35850/files/10992811/preview?verifier=qEaP7rjYoAt2Nb8BIcXuagJ9gAGgL5daYC8kjm6z\" alt=\"confirm merge.png\" data-api-endpoint=\"https://canvas.nau.edu/api/v1/courses/35850/files/10992811\" data-api-returntype=\"File\"></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\">And, voila, finally the merging happened and the pull request will be closed:</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><img id=\"10077389\" src=\"https://canvas.nau.edu/courses/35850/files/10992813/preview?verifier=yjtjXL9mXv3VgBkT01m5blLfnIzoOIjq0JL0DX1b\" alt=\"pull request 4.png\" data-api-endpoint=\"https://canvas.nau.edu/api/v1/courses/35850/files/10992813\" data-api-returntype=\"File\"></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\">Don't delete your branch, however. You will want to keep it for future reference, as encouraged in Henrik's video.</p>\n<p>Keeping the branch has a consequence, however, which ultimately dictates what you need to do now, i.e. you need to sync the following branches, in this order:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><code>main</code> on your Ubuntu server - this is a <code>git pull</code>,</li>\n<li><code>helloworld</code> on your Ubuntu server - this is a <code>git merge</code> and</li>\n<li><code>helloworld</code> on your GitHub server - this is a <code>git push</code>.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>These are <span style=\"color: #ff0000;\">red steps 4, 5 and 6</span> in the schema - with step 6 being the \"overlap\" that I mentioned before. All of that is done on your Ubuntu server. Let's go ahead and do steps 4, 5 and 6 in one go and also have a look at the <code>git log</code> from the <code>helloworld</code> branch:</p>\n<p>Step 4</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><img id=\"10077617\" src=\"https://canvas.nau.edu/courses/35850/files/10992814/preview?verifier=MbpEGbOmQBtWhnSajh21uhxAFhD3K4codqVmGMsi\" alt=\"git checkout pull step 4.png\" data-api-endpoint=\"https://canvas.nau.edu/api/v1/courses/35850/files/10992814\" data-api-returntype=\"File\"></p>\n<p>Step 5</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><img id=\"10077646\" src=\"https://canvas.nau.edu/courses/35850/files/10992815/preview?verifier=aZbAo9rarJ3FpR2yZpW7ZqXzPUqR1UofFxKzb5vR\" alt=\"git checkout merge step 5.png\" data-api-endpoint=\"https://canvas.nau.edu/api/v1/courses/35850/files/10992815\" data-api-returntype=\"File\"></p>\n<p>Step 6</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><img id=\"10077684\" src=\"https://canvas.nau.edu/courses/35850/files/10992816/preview?verifier=XsOX7eiU47fIDCkLrgzlQnDSCHjcW1wkhFhD8kzg\" alt=\"git push step 6.png\" data-api-endpoint=\"https://canvas.nau.edu/api/v1/courses/35850/files/10992816\" data-api-returntype=\"File\"></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\">&nbsp;</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\">And you are done! You successfully finished one complete workflow cycle!</p>\n<h2>What to Do - Your Turn!</h2>\n<p>Now let's put your experiences that you made above to work. I want you to go through TWO FULL CYCLES like that:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Add a file README.md to your <code>helloworld</code> repo, going through <span style=\"color: #ff0000;\">red steps 1 through 6</span>. Remember that you need to do the green steps only in the very beginning and you are past that, so don't bother. To document what you are doing, take one screenshot of each one of the steps - in the very same way as I have done above. There is one exception though: for step 3, i.e. the pull request/merge, only take the screenshot that is showing the end result, which was the last screenshot of the whole series above showing \"Pull request successfully merged and closed\".</li>\n<li>Now, do the same all over again (... repetition is the mother of wisdom ...), this time changing the output of the program from \"hello world\" to \"Hello world!\". Again, document each one of the steps as you did in the first round.&nbsp;</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>What to submit</h2>\n<p>Convince yourself that you need to have 12 screenshots altogether. Create a word document that has two sections:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\"Section 1 - Adding README.md\"</li>\n<li>\"Section 2 - Changing Output\"</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Each section has a quick sub header \"Step 1\", \"Step 2\" all the way up to \"Step 6\". Under each of those headers, put the screenshot that pertains to that section/step.</p>\n<p>Submit on Canvas.</p>\n<h2>Grading Guide</h2>\n<p>This assignment earns <strong>24 points</strong>, two points per screenshot. Each screenshot needs to be 100% correct to earn its two points.</p><script src=\"https://instructure-uploads-pdx.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/account_196640000000000001/attachments/10113060/dp_app.js\"></script>","due_at":"2025-02-08T06:59:00Z","unlock_at":null,"lock_at":"2025-02-09T06:59:00Z","points_possible":24,"grading_type":"points","assignment_group_id":158397,"grading_standard_id":null,"created_at":"2024-12-20T16:04:31Z","updated_at":"2025-02-06T03:18:01Z","peer_reviews":false,"automatic_peer_reviews":false,"position":3,"grade_group_students_individually":false,"anonymous_peer_reviews":false,"group_category_id":null,"post_to_sis":false,"moderated_grading":false,"omit_from_final_grade":false,"intra_group_peer_reviews":false,"anonymous_instructor_annotations":false,"anonymous_grading":false,"graders_anonymous_to_graders":false,"grader_count":0,"grader_comments_visible_to_graders":true,"final_grader_id":null,"grader_names_visible_to_final_grader":true,"allowed_attempts":-1,"annotatable_attachment_id":null,"hide_in_gradebook":false,"secure_params":"eyJ0eXAiOiJKV1QiLCJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9.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.dNZ6QU5vgbgqwmbjD1tKz6gOLnKkLhx1YX-Heb-IIaA","lti_context_id":"72bfa37d-95c8-4ca7-9bc5-4670d3ba5659","course_id":"35850","name":"1.

{"id":717212,"description":"<link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"https://instructure-uploads-pdx.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/account_196640000000000001/attachments/10113062/dp_app.css\"><h2>Purpose</h2>\n<p>In the last assignment you have learned about the basic workflow when working with GitHub. Specifically, you have gained an understanding of the interplay between the GitHub server that contains the precious <code>main</code> branch that needs to be accessed and updated carefully in a very controlled way - and the copy of the repo on your remote site, in our case your Ubuntu server.</p>\n<p>What we are going to do now is to extend this idea to a team setting. You can imagine that the GitHub server will now become a central HUB (\"nomen est omen\" - the name gives it away ...) for a whole team, where all of the team members can easily access the (same!) code base on that server. Luckily, and likely to your surprise, that won't change much in the basic workflow. The only thing that needs to be done additionally is to add all team members to the repo as what is called \"collaborators\", which provides them with <code>clone</code>, <code>pull</code> and <code>push</code> privileges.</p>\n<p>Before you do so, however, let me ask you to take a minute and reflect upon what you have done in the previous assignment. Don't skip over it, as understanding what I'm going to tell you will make your life much easier for this assignment. Specifically, focus on the <span style=\"color: #ff0000;\">red step 3</span>: remember that you created a pull request, which asked to integrate/merge your changes into the <code>main</code> branch on GitHub. As this is an extremely critical step, your team may want to discuss your changes and provide feedback, before, ultimately, the permission is granted to make the merge happen. But the permission of whom? In the last assignment it was YOU, as you were the<em> owner of the repo</em> and the<em> pull requestor</em> at the same time. In a team setting, those two persons will be different people! <strong>And this is already the main difference to a team setting, as easy as that!</strong></p>\n<p>For your reference, here is the workflow chart again. I detailed the <span style=\"color: #ff0000;\">red step 3</span> as this has an impact on the separation of roles that we will see in the team setting context:</p>\n<p><img id=\"10104597\" src=\"https://canvas.nau.edu/courses/35850/files/10992826/preview?verifier=mo9OOnpjtSE77yNAEMo2BUPZYBWeQGVJ09sPe2uS\" alt=\"GitHub Basic Workflow 2.jpg\" data-api-endpoint=\"https://canvas.nau.edu/api/v1/courses/35850/files/10992826\" data-api-returntype=\"File\"></p>\n<h2>Preparation</h2>\n<p>Before we start, you need to do some setting up. Obviously, this is going to be a team project ... we will have a team of two, which is you and you. Yes, you read that right, you will take on two roles: a) the <strong>owner of the repository</strong> who will discuss and approve of pull requests and doing the merge - and b) the \"other you\", a plain ol'<strong> team member</strong>, who is going to do the changes to the code base and asking for those changes to be admitted into <code>main</code>, by way of a <code>pull</code> request.</p>\n<h4><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Step 0 - Get a second account on GitHub</span></h4>\n<p>To pull this off, pun intended, you will need to have a second account on GitHub. This second account will take on the role of the \"repo owner\", while the account that you have been working with will take on the role of one of the \"team members\". In our case, the only team member. For clarity, throughout the course of this assignment, I will refer to the two different people as <strong>OWNER</strong> (your new, second account) and <strong>MEMBER </strong>(the account that you have been working with). Admittedly, that sounds a bit schizophrenic and in a way it is. However, in this arrangement you can make both roles' experiences at the same time, without the need to rely on a peer, which may create some serious headaches of its own. After all, if you don't pull your weight as a MEMBER (again, pun intended, yawn ...), the only other person that you as an OWNER can be mad at is you ...</p>\n<p>Now go ahead and create a second free account on GitHub. You will need to have a second email in order to get an account. I'm sure you have an NAU email and another one for your private affairs. I leave it up to you to figure it out.</p>\n<p>... okay, are you done? If not, don't even think about going on. Go back and git/get your second account ...</p>\n<h4><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Step 1 - Setting up a Repository on GitHub for Team Work</span></h4>\n<p><span style=\"color: #ff0000;\"><strong>OWNER</strong></span>, download the <code>nqueens</code> project code from <a class=\"instructure_file_link inline_disabled\" title=\"nqueens.zip\" href=\"https://canvas.nau.edu/courses/35850/files/10992827?verifier=9lhNfHIZTRUO8z9rWyYaBuANacd6kgBhKxdXymuI&amp;wrap=1\" target=\"_blank\" data-api-endpoint=\"https://canvas.nau.edu/api/v1/courses/35850/files/10992827\" data-api-returntype=\"File\">here</a>. Expand the archive on your local machine and open up a Finder (on a Mac) or Explorer (on Win) window such that you see all the files in the <code>nqueens</code> folder.</p>\n<p>Log into your new account and create a new repository called <code>nqueens</code>. Now, instead of creating files directly on GitHub like you did before, drag all files in the <code>nqueens</code> folder into your repo, importing all of them at once - watch out for the link \"uploading an existing file\". Don't, however, drag in the <code>nqueens</code> folder itself, or you will end up with that folder within the repo! Commit the change, with an \"Initial Commit\" message. Here is what you should be looking at at that point:</p>\n<p><img id=\"10097304\" src=\"https://canvas.nau.edu/courses/35850/files/10992823/preview?verifier=UPHPygujG08HcnoSE2oWlQy99jHxBuw0LZNzq5Mw\" alt=\"teams initial commit.png\" data-api-endpoint=\"https://canvas.nau.edu/api/v1/courses/35850/files/10992823\" data-api-returntype=\"File\"></p>\n<p>Go to your repo's \"Settings\" and click \"Collaborators\". Here you will add the one team member that you will have. In GitHub lingo, that is a \"Collaborator\". And, needless to say, that collaborator is MEMBER. Click on the green \"Add people\" button and put in MEMBER's GitHub name, which will invite MEMBER into your team. If all went well, you will see that the invite of MEMBER is pending:</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><img id=\"10114945\" src=\"https://canvas.nau.edu/courses/35850/files/10992828/preview?verifier=fTHQnEs6xpi8sHsP7MiHGX1HxQ58uDXHfUXR60yO\" alt=\"collaborator pending.png\" data-api-endpoint=\"https://canvas.nau.edu/api/v1/courses/35850/files/10992828\" data-api-returntype=\"File\"></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #0000ff;\"><strong>Take a screenshot that shows the pending invite part of the screen as I have done above [OWNER 1]&nbsp;</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #ff0000;\"><strong>MEMBER</strong></span>, log into your account on GitHub.

If you don't get the green \"Accept invitation\" button, right-click on the \"accept or decline\" link, copy the link and go to a totally unrelated browser, e.g. Chrome, if you are in Safari. Paste the link into the location line, hit enter and now you should see the above image that allows you to accept the invitation.&nbsp; <strong><span style=\"color: #0000ff;\">Take a screenshot of that invite offer that looks just like the image above [MEMBER 1]</span></strong></p>\n<p>Now click the green \"Accept invitation\" button - that will open up the project of OWNER. Here you need to understand that you are NOT looking at a copy of the repo. Rather, you are looking at the real deal, i.e. the repo itself, just like several people reading the same newspaper!</p>\n<p>If you heed to log out of GitHub for some reason and get back in again later on, finding the repo is not really straightforward. First you click on your avatar in the upper right, click on \"Settings\" (... Not on \"Your repositories\"! You won't find it there as you are not the owner of the repo), then click on \"Repositories\", where you will see it.</p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #ff0000;\"><strong>OWNER</strong></span>, go to the page with your collaborators. Reload it, you should now see that your MEMBER has accepted the invitation as there is no mention of \"pending\" any more. <span style=\"color: #0000ff;\"><strong>Take a screenshot that shows the MEMBER being a collaborator [OWNER 2]&nbsp;</strong></span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;And, <span style=\"color: #ff0000;\"><strong>OWNER</strong></span> and <span style=\"color: #ff0000;\"><strong>MEMBER</strong></span>, you guys did it! You successfully set up a repo and can now start working on it together ... with a little bit of creativity, imagine that there are some more team MEMBERs that are all seeing the same repo ...</p>\n<p>Now, let's get to work!</p>\n<h2>Creating Changes and Merging them back into the Code Base</h2>\n<h4><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Step 2: Applying some Changes</span></h4>\n<p><span style=\"color: #ff0000;\"><strong>MEMBER</strong></span>, go to your Ubuntu server and clone the repo <code>nqueens</code>. Remember how to get the link that you need to pass to the <code>git clone</code> call ... that's right, you get it from the repo on GitHub: click \"Code\", then \"SSH\" and copy the link! This is <span style=\"color: #169179;\">green step 1</span> <strong><span style=\"color: #0000ff;\">Take a screenshot of the output of the successful </span></strong><span style=\"color: #0000ff;\"><code>git clone</code></span><strong><span style=\"color: #0000ff;\"> call [MEMBER 2]&nbsp;</span></strong></p>\n<p>Explore the code that you just cloned. You are encouraged to compile and run it. It doesn't have a Makefile, so you will need to compile it manually like that:&nbsp;</p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"><code>gcc&nbsp;-o&nbsp;nqueens&nbsp;main.c&nbsp;utils.c&nbsp;solver.c</code></span></p>\n<p>Now open up the file <span class=\"s1\"><code>solver.c</code></span> in vim and have a look at line #7. Assume that you have the genius epiphany that changing the <span class=\"s1\"><code>true</code></span> in that line to a <span class=\"s1\"><code>false</code></span> will make the program output ALL solutions of the N Queens problem, instead of just the very first one. As you will want to make any changes in a new branch, create a branch <span class=\"s1\"><code>playground</code></span> and switch into it - this is <span style=\"color: #169179;\">green step 2</span>. Make the change, save, stage and commit it with a commit message \"All solutions\", this is <span style=\"color: #ff0000;\">red step 1</span>.</p>\n<h4><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Step 3: Push and Pull Request</span></h4>\n<p>Now remember what comes next ... you will want to have your change (living in your branch &nbsp;<span class=\"s1\"><code>playground</code></span> ) merged into <span class=\"s1\"><code>main</code></span> on GitHub! So, <span class=\"s1\"><code>push</code></span> your change onto GitHub, <span style=\"color: #ff0000;\">red step 2</span>. That will create a copy of your branch <span class=\"s1\"><code>playground</code></span> on GitHub, which is the basis for the next step, your pull request. So get onto GitHub and create a <span class=\"s1\"><code>pull request</code></span> - this is <span style=\"color: #ff0000;\">red step 3a</span>. All of that you should be well familiar with! <strong><span style=\"color: #0000ff;\">Take a screenshot of the pull request window</span></strong><strong><span style=\"color: #0000ff;\"> [MEMBER 3]</span></strong></p>\n<h4><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Step 4: Review and Merge</span></h4>\n<p><strong><span style=\"color: #ff0000;\">OWNER</span></strong>, take a look at the pull request that you will have received at that point. Before you merge, ask a few questions that mimic a review.</p>\n<p><strong><span style=\"color: #ff0000;\">MEMBER</span></strong>, go along and answer the <strong>OWNER's </strong>questions to her/his full satisfaction, after all you don't want to mess with yourself, haha ... Please note that as an outcome of the discussion, you may add to the pull request just by going through <span style=\"color: #ff0000;\">red steps 1 and 2 again</span>&nbsp; ... and again ...!</p>\n<p><strong><span style=\"color: #ff0000;\">OWNER</span></strong>, finally merge the proposed change into main - this is <span style=\"color: #ff0000;\">red step 3b</span>. <strong><span style=\"color: #0000ff;\">Take a screenshot of the successful merge/closed pull request</span></strong><strong><span style=\"color: #0000ff;\">&nbsp;[OWNER 3]</span></strong></p>\n<h4><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Step 5: Synching back the Merge into the Remote Repository</span></h4>\n<p><strong><span style=\"color: #ff0000;\">MEMBER</span></strong>, the rest is easy, you now need to close the workflow cycle by circling back, including the overlap ... that will lead to a perfect and complete sync of ALL FOUR branches - these are <span style=\"color: #ff0000;\">red steps 4, 5 and 6</span>. Once you are done with that, call <span class=\"s1\"><code>git log</code></span> from your <span class=\"s1\"><code>playground</code></span>&nbsp;branch. <strong><span style=\"color: #0000ff;\">Take a screenshot of that log output</span></strong><strong><span style=\"color: #0000ff;\"> [MEMBER 4]</span></strong></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #ff0000;\"><strong>OWNER</strong></span> and <span style=\"color: #ff0000;\"><strong>MEMBER</strong></span>, congratulations, you are done, this time for good! I hope you guys still like each other ...&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>What to submit</h2>\n<p>Create an MS Word or PDF document. In that document, create two sections, the first section for the OWNER, the second section for the MEMBER. In each of the two sections, put in the screenshots in the order as they appear above. Make sure that all of the OWNER's screenshots go into the OWNER's section, while all of the MEMBER's screenshots go into the MEMBER's section.</p>\n<p>FOR EACH SCREENSHOT, you NEED to add a sentence or two that comments on what should be seen on that specific screenshot.

All you need to know is that the program implements a simple server that returns the local time when hit with a web browser. It is elaborate enough, however, to have some nice dependencies that need to be honored in the <code>Makefile</code>.</p>\n<h2>Heads-up</h2>\n<p>Creating Makefiles is a very complex area. You can get totally crazy with it. And perhaps you already have some experience with that ... making <code>Makefiles</code> that is, not becoming crazy ...</p>\n<p>In this exercise, however, I ask you to stay strictly within the limitations of what the last three videos about how to create Makefiles demonstrated. I ask you to diligently follow the instructions and create targets, dependencies and rules <strong>exactly and directly</strong> as given to you. Directly means that you are not allowed to rely on make's smartness so you can rely on rules/dependencies implicitly created for you without spelling them out explicitly. I and my graders will NOT engage in any discussions why your Makefile does work (and it actually may or may not), when you have not honored what I have just said.</p>\n<p>In case you wonder why I am insisting on this, here is the simple truth: grading becomes infeasible otherwise, if I don't confine the possible solution space to something manageable. With the number of students that we have, we just cannot afford to get tied up in heated discussions about little details, when you have not followed instructions to begin with. This is based on experiences - thank you for your understanding.&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>What to Do</h2>\n<p>In this assignment you will do the following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Download a small software package that implements a Web Time Server. Copy it over to your platform and <code>unzip</code> it.</li>\n<li>Write a <code>Makefile</code> that builds the executable from the software package.</li>\n<li>Verify that the <code>Makefile</code> actually works.</li>\n<li>Run the Web Time Server on your platform and verify that it works.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Part 1: Download the Web Time Server package, copy, unzip</h3>\n<p>Please click <a class=\"instructure_file_link inline_disabled\" title=\"webtimeserver.zip\" href=\"https://canvas.nau.edu/courses/35850/files/10992789?verifier=AG33aMByp5SVbbRShibsE22N6ppVJbWvWzaEVHEU&amp;wrap=1\" target=\"_blank\" data-api-endpoint=\"https://canvas.nau.edu/api/v1/courses/35850/files/10992789\" data-api-returntype=\"File\">here</a> to download the package. Copy it to your platform and <code>unzip</code> it. <strong><span style=\"color: #0000ff;\">Take a screenshot of the directory structure of the unzipped software package using the <code>tree</code> command [1]. </span></strong>If the <code>tree</code> command is not on your system, install it. If you don't know how to do it - well, you are in CR305 ... I expect you to figure it out on your own.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Part 2: Write a Makefile</h3>\n<p>This is the most important part of the assignment, so please implement the below specs carefully, to the letter, see my heads-up above.</p>\n<p>The software package consists of a number of files, which have, when it comes to build an executable out of them, certain dependencies. Each one of those dependencies need to have an explicit expression in you <code>Makefile</code>.</p>\n<p>Here are the targets that I want you to reflect in your <code>Makefile</code>, along with their dependencies:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<code>wts</code> - depending on:\n<ul>\n<li><code>webtimeserver.o</code></li>\n<li><code>threadpool.o</code></li>\n<li><code>properties.o</code></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<code>webtimeserver.o</code> - depending on:\n<ul>\n<li><code>webtimeserver/webtimeserver.c</code></li>\n<li><code>webtimeserver/webtimeserver.h</code></li>\n<li><code>debug/dbg.h</code></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<code>threadpool.o</code> - depending on:\n<ul>\n<li><code>threadpool/threadpool.c</code></li>\n<li><code>threadpool/threadpool.h</code></li>\n<li><code>debug/dbg.h</code></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<code>properties.o</code> - depending on:\n<ul>\n<li><code>properties/properties.c</code></li>\n<li><code>properties/properties.h</code></li>\n<li><code>debug/dbg.h</code></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<code>clean</code> - the job of this target is to remove all object files, i.e. files with extension <code>.o</code>\n</li>\n<li>I also want you to put the program name of the compiler into a variable <code>CC</code>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Furthermore, be aware of the following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<code>webtimeserver.o</code>, <code>threadpool.o</code> and <code>properties.o</code> need to be compiled with the <code>-c</code> option</li>\n<li>\n<code>wts</code> is NOT compiled with the <code>-c</code> option, BUT it needs to be compiled with the <code>pthread</code> library. This is done with the <code>-lpthread</code> option, that you will want to put at the end of the compiler call.</li>\n<li>I want you to honor the directory structure, it is NOT allowed to jumble all files into one folder!</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Honoring the above specs, write your <code>Makefile</code>. <strong><span style=\"color: #0000ff;\">Take a screenshot of the COLOR-CODED content of your Makefile [2]</span></strong>!</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Part 3: Verify the proper working of your <code>Makefile</code>\n</h3>\n<p>Do the following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Copy your <code>Makefile</code> into the root of the unzipped software package.</li>\n<li>Make sure that you remove all compilation products by calling <code>make clean</code>.</li>\n<li>Now call <code>make</code>, and directly after that call <code>ll</code> to show the contents of the directory. <strong><span style=\"color: #0000ff;\">Take a screenshot of the part of the screen that matters [3].</span></strong>\n</li>\n<li>While you stay in the directory, call <code>touch debug/dbg.h</code>. Run <code>make</code> again. <strong><span style=\"color: #0000ff;\">Take a screenshot of the part of the screen that matters [4].</span></strong>\n</li>\n<li>Again, while you stay in the directory, call <code>touch properties/properties.h</code>. <span>Run&nbsp;</span><code>make</code><span>&nbsp;again.&nbsp;</span><strong><span style=\"color: #0000ff;\">Take a screenshot of the part of the screen that matters [5].</span></strong>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Part 4: Run the Web Time Server</h3>\n<p>Make sure that you have your executable <code>wts</code> ready. Call <code>wts</code> on the command line. Your <code>default.properties</code> file needs to be located in the same directory as <code>wts</code>, if it is not, adjust the <code>path_to</code> accordingly:&nbsp;</p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><code>wts [path_to/]default.properties</code></p>\n<p>Open a browser and direct it to:</p>\n<p><code>http://[your ip goes here, without the brackets]:23657</code></p>\n<p>That looks something like that:</p>\n<p><img id=\"9227704\" src=\"https://canvas.nau.edu/courses/35850/files/10992787/preview?verifier=VVN6qFFB9C3mOVsyQWhNHLGhfxtTfiqSy6bAJw51\" alt=\"wts 1.png\" width=\"545\" height=\"165\" data-api-endpoint=\"https://canvas.nau.edu/api/v1/courses/35850/files/10992787\" data-api-returntype=\"File\"></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Once you hit enter, you get something like this:</p>\n<p><img id=\"9227807\" src=\"https://canvas.nau.edu/courses/35850/files/10992788/preview?verifier=9BuP9Vm3uYCLE2Xbrx1Ikrje1HFNfGjJId60sWXG\" alt=\"wts 2.png\" width=\"541\" height=\"351\" data-api-endpoint=\"https://canvas.nau.edu/api/v1/courses/35850/files/10992788\" data-api-returntype=\"File\"></p>\n<p><strong><span style=\"color: #0000ff;\">Take a screenshot of the part of the screen that matters [6].</span></strong></p>\n<h2>What to submit</h2>\n<p>Create an MS Word or PDF document that contains the following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>You need to create four headlines, each one corresponding to the first four parts.</li>\n<li>Under each part's headline, put all the screenshots that you are required to take in that part.

Navigate to the EC2 dashboard and click \"Launch Instance\".</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Part 1 - Set up EC2 Instance</h3>\n<ol start=\"1\">\n<li>\n<h4><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Name your Instance</span></h4>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Give your instance some name that your are fine with, e.g. cs105, mickeymouse etc.</p>\n<ol start=\"2\">\n<li>\n<h4><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Choose your AMI (Amazon Machine Image)</span></h4>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>In this step you will choose the operating system for your instance. Choose a free-tier eligible Linux option - specifically <span>Ubuntu Server 24.04 LTS.</span></p>\n<p><span>Make absolutely sure that you do, indeed, choose Ubuntu! I thought I did and ended up with Amazon Linux for some reason that I still don't fully understand. After the dust has settled and you start working with your instance, a tell-tale sign that you ended up with something else but Ubuntu is that <code>apt</code> and <code>apt-get</code> is not available on that system (it certainly is not available on Amazon Linux). In that case I ask you to start over, you have a second chance without needing to pay any money.</span></p>\n<ol start=\"3\">\n<li>\n<h4><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"> Instance type</span></h4>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Under Instance type, choose a free tier type accepting all of the default options, likely <span><code>t2.micro</code></span>. Glance at the options to get a sense of the types of things that can be done here.</p>\n<ol start=\"4\">\n<li>\n<h4><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Key pair (login)</span></h4>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>This is an important one! We will get back to that further down. A key pair is needed to securely <code>ssh</code> into your new EC2 instance.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Select \"Create new key pair\"</li>\n<li>Give the Key Pair a name — e.g. ‘cs305’</li>\n<li>Click \"Create Key Pair\", upon which it should download cs305.pem.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Note that what got downloaded is a file that contains only the private RSA key part of the two-part key pair. The public key part is going to be installed for you automatically on your instance. Once you have access to your instance, you can see the public key in &nbsp;<code>~/.ssh/authorized_keys</code>.</p>\n<ol start=\"5\">\n<li>\n<h4><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"> Network settings</span></h4>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>In this step, you will choose the type of traffic your instance will allow from the outside. You need to allow two types of traffic — SSH (so we can log in to the virtual laptop) and HTTP (so we can view our webpage through the browser).</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Select \"Create a new security group\". Enter anything you want for the name and description.</li>\n<li>Keep the SSH rule that is already listed. (Allow SSH traffic from anywhere).</li>\n<li>Click the checkbox to enable \"Allow HTTPS traffic from the Internet\" and \"Allow HTTP traffic from the Internet.\"</li>\n</ul>\n<ol start=\"6\">\n<li>\n<h4><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"> Configure Storage, Advanced details</span></h4>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>You should accept the default options and move to the next step.</p>\n<ol start=\"7\">\n<li>\n<h4><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"> Summary</span></h4>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Click \"Launch Instance\". Then click \"View all instances\" to see a table of your instances (this is your EC2 dashboard). There should be a row for your newly launched instance. <strong><span style=\"color: #0000ff;\">Take a screenshot showing that table, i.e. similar to this:</span></strong></p>\n<p><img id=\"9355363\" src=\"https://canvas.nau.edu/courses/35850/files/10992790/preview?verifier=a4lt365d3SOifucRpdLxhC5njeMjhcAcNq3hql39\" alt=\"instances.png\" data-api-endpoint=\"https://canvas.nau.edu/api/v1/courses/35850/files/10992790\" data-api-returntype=\"File\"></p>\n<p>Note that in the above image I already selected my instance by clicking on the little checkbox. Otherwise, you cannot use any of the menu options in the upper right, that allow you to choose, e.g. \"Connect\" or to reboot/stop your instance.</p>\n<h3>Part 2: Configure your Instance</h3>\n<ol start=\"8\">\n<li>\n<h4><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"> Set up SSH key on your local machine</span></h4>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Navigate to your terminal and do the following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Change the permissions on your private key file. First, save the downloaded private key file <code>.pem</code>&nbsp;to your <code>~/.ssh</code> directory.</li>\n<li>Then change the permissions of that file to user read only - this is for security reasons. Without that step, you won't be able to access your system. On Mac and Linux, that is done with the following command (find out yourself how to do that on Windoofs):<br><code>chmod 400 &lt;path_to_key_pair_file&gt;</code>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<ol start=\"9\">\n<li>\n<h4><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">SSH into your new EC2 instance</span></h4>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>For this step you need to know what your instances' IP address is. The thing is that AWS does not give you a \"raw\" IP address, even if it looks like that. Here you see my instance table, scrolled a bit to the right:</p>\n<p><img id=\"9355389\" src=\"https://canvas.nau.edu/courses/35850/files/10992791/preview?verifier=5Pfk6WSOY8P8JzYjVukCDWn3IA8xFX25HTEMYc8n\" alt=\"ip.png\" width=\"311\" height=\"160\" data-api-endpoint=\"https://canvas.nau.edu/api/v1/courses/35850/files/10992791\" data-api-returntype=\"File\"></p>\n<p>There is a field <span>Public IPv4 address showing 52.15.104.106. But that IP cannot be used directly, unlike is the case with other ISPs, like Hostwinds.com or Linode.com. With AWS you need to go through a hostname that is resolved by DNS into some concrete IP. You find that hostname by clicking \"Connect\" in the upper right (remember what I said above, you need to check your instance ...) and then \"SSH client\". You will see something like that:</span></p>\n<p><span><img id=\"9355432\" src=\"https://canvas.nau.edu/courses/35850/files/10992792/preview?verifier=8MJVs5GBVlI0tjiuNTEQsf0MQ5Nm6fivjdsQ0T9c\" alt=\"connect.png\" data-api-endpoint=\"https://canvas.nau.edu/api/v1/courses/35850/files/10992792\" data-api-returntype=\"File\"></span></p>\n<p>Pay special attention to the \"Example\", which has been created already with your specific information in mind. You may want to notice two important things:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Your login user name is going to be \"ubuntu\".</li>\n<li>Your server name. In the above picture you see my hostname, your's will look the same structurally, but different in the details:<br><code><span>ec2-52-15-104-106.us-east-2.compute.amazonaws.com</span></code><br><br>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>That said, you are ready to <code>ssh</code> into your instance, using the above information. You may not need the <code>-i</code> option along with the <code>path/keyfilename</code>, when you put your private ssh key file into <code>.ssh</code>. But it's good to know that you may put it anywhere, then that option comes in handy:</p>\n<p><code>ssh [-i path/keyfilename] ubuntu@server_name</code></p>\n<p>Type yes to continue. At this point, your terminal is now directly connected with your EC2 instance.</p>\n<p>Elevate your privileges: <code>sudo su</code></p>\n<ol start=\"10\">\n<li>\n<h4><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"> Update all of the packages on the instance</span></h4>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p><code>sudo apt update</code></p>\n<p><code>sudo apt upgrade</code></p>\n<p><strong><span style=\"color: #0000ff;\">Take a screenshot showing your terminal window.</span></strong></p>\n<h2>What to submit</h2>\n<p>Only complete submissions earn credit.</p>\n<p>Create an MS Word or PDF document that contains the two screenshots that you took above.</p>\n<p>Submit on Canvas.</p>\n<h2>Grading Guide</h2>\n<p>This assignment earns 10 points if your document shows the correct screenshots, all-or-nothing.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><script src=\"https://instructure-uploads-pdx.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/account_196640000000000001/attachments/10113060/dp_app.js\"></script>","due_at":"2025-03-22T06:59:00Z","unlock_at":null,"lock_at":"2025-03-23T06:59:59Z","points_possible":10,"grading_type":"points","assignment_group_id":158397,"grading_standard_id":null,"created_at":"2024-12-20T16:04:30Z","updated_at":"2025-01-04T20:02:16Z","peer_reviews":false,"automatic_peer_reviews":false,"position":8,"grade_group_students_individually":false,"anonymous_peer_reviews":false,"group_category_id":null,"post_to_sis":false,"moderated_grading":false,"omit_from_final_grade":false,"intra_group_peer_reviews":false,"anonymous_instructor_annotations":false,"anonymous_grading":false,"graders_anonymous_to_graders":false,"grader_count":0,"grader_comments_visible_to_graders":true,"final_grader_id":null,"grader_names_visible_to_final_grader":true,"allowed_attempts":-1,"annotatable_attachment_id":null,"hide_in_gradebook":false,"secure_params":"eyJ0eXAiOiJKV1QiLCJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9.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.hkQgonAwDDNEfteTry5D5bkwndzte7qC-vY7BPOr42Y","lti_context_id":"2d820839-70fa-4687-a524-1e2cd5a6db87","course_id":"35850","name":"3.

By default, the Apache web server will display the <code>index.html</code> file found in the <code>/var/www/html </code>directory. Paste the server's address into your browser and hit &lt;enter&gt; - Apache's default webpage should be displayed.</p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #0000ff;\"><strong>Take a screenshot of your browser screen that shows the apache default webpage. The screenshot needs to contain the location line [1]</strong></span></p>\n<p>Now let's do a few more steps, at the end of which you will have your own website! How cool is that?!!!</p>\n<h3>Part 2: Installing your own document root on your web server</h3>\n<p><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Configure document root folder&nbsp;access</span></p>\n<p>This step will allow you to use a directory called <code>~/public_html</code>&nbsp;as document root, where you can put your web content, instead of <code>/var/www/html</code>. You will also want to restart apache to enable the changes:</p>\n<p><code>a2enmod userdir</code></p>\n<p><code>systemctl restart apache2</code></p>\n<p><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Configure your document root folder <code>~/public_html</code></span></p>\n<p>First, you need to create a directory <code>~/public_html</code>, which will be the \"document root\" of your site, which means that all of your web content will go there. Before you do so, exit out of being root by calling <code>exit</code>, which will change you back into your good old user <code>ubuntu</code>:</p>\n<p><code>exit</code></p>\n<p>Change into your home directory <code>/home/ubuntu</code> and issue:</p>\n<p><code>mkdir public_html</code></p>\n<p>Now, give that directory the correct rights such that you can do everything, the group can read and execute and anyone else can't do anything:</p>\n<p><code>chmod 750 public_html</code></p>\n<p>The problem with this set of rights is, however, that the user that runs the Apache server, i.e. <code>www-data</code>, won't have access to your web content. Let's change that by adding <code>www-data</code> to your group, which happens to have the same name as your user name, i.e. <code>ubuntu</code>:</p>\n<p><code>sudo usermod -a -G ubuntu www-data </code></p>\n<p>Finally, throw in an extra restart of the Apache service, for good measure, as we have applied some changes that Apache will want to know about:</p>\n<p><code>sudo systemctl restart apache2</code></p>\n<p>... and you are done configuring your Apache server. It is now ready to go to serve web content directly from your doc root. In the next step, you will want to check that the outside world does actually have access to your site ...</p>\n<h3>Part 3: Add content to be served to your document root folder</h3>\n<p><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Prepare Content and install on server</span></p>\n<p>In order to have something to display, whip up a quick web page that you will want to call <code>index.html</code> and put that page into <code>~/public_html</code>. That will become the default page to be displayed, which the web server will be looking for, if it doesn't know any better. Your simple web page may look something like that, please adapt to whatever you want to have displayed:</p>\n<p><img id=\"9843681\" src=\"https://canvas.nau.edu/courses/35850/files/10992785/preview?verifier=pwRvKXoFgCPAdknLMSBEsyJgjcxZHPLYRWbibcFn\" alt=\"index.html.png\" width=\"384\" height=\"302\" data-api-endpoint=\"https://canvas.nau.edu/api/v1/courses/35850/files/10992785\" data-api-returntype=\"File\"></p>\n<h4><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Confirm that your server is hosting index.html</span></h4>\n<p>Paste your server's address into your browser's location line and add your user name, preceded by a slash and the tilde character <code>/~</code>.

However, this time you are going to run it in the cloud.</p>\n<h2>What to Do</h2>\n<h3>Part 1: Build the Web Time Server</h3>\n<p>Use your credentials to log into your EC2 instance:</p>\n<p><code>ssh [-i path/private_key_file] ubuntu@server_name</code></p>\n<p>Get the Web Time Server from the \"Building Software\" module. Upload it onto your EC2 instance and build it with the <code>Makefile</code> that allows you to have it build automatically.</p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #0000ff;\"><strong>Take a screenshot of the output of the tree command, showing the complete tree of directories and files of the built Web Time Server, along with the command prompt that shows that you are on your EC2 instance [1].</strong></span></p>\n<h3>Part 2: Configure Security Group</h3>\n<p>Now you need to make sure that your Web Time Server is accessible from the outside, which means that the port the server is going to run on is open. AWS are very restrictive. While other providers let all ports open, with AWS you have to open each port that you are using individually, for the better or worse.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>What you need to do now is to add a rule that allows the Web Time Server to accept traffic on the port that you see in the <code>default.properties</code>&nbsp; file, which is part of the Web Time Server package. Go ahead and look up that port number first, then ask \"Amazon Q\", which is the AWS AI wizard, how to add this \"inbound rule\". A viable question that I suggest you ask is \"<span>how do I add an inbound rule</span>\". You can access the wizard by clicking on the wizard symbol on the far right of the screen. Here is what it looks like for me:</p>\n<p><img id=\"9387688\" src=\"https://canvas.nau.edu/courses/35850/files/10992797/preview?verifier=Ir42yzpMpXqjCVmBTSsZPWYUWverygSAli0laFqb\" alt=\"Amazon Q.png\" width=\"286\" height=\"164\" data-api-endpoint=\"https://canvas.nau.edu/api/v1/courses/35850/files/10992797\" data-api-returntype=\"File\"></p>\n<p>Follow the instructions of the wizard to install the rule that opens up the server port. If all goes well, your new set of rules look like that, assuming the port is 23657O</p>\n<p><img id=\"9387690\" src=\"https://canvas.nau.edu/courses/35850/files/10992796/preview?verifier=8woKTwmLlFCXxnZg5ilyMcuwVJynt1yjmNex8FGE\" alt=\"inbound rules.png\" data-api-endpoint=\"https://canvas.nau.edu/api/v1/courses/35850/files/10992796\" data-api-returntype=\"File\"></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #0000ff;\"><strong>Take a screenshot of your set of inbound rules</strong><strong>&nbsp;[2].</strong></span>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Part 3: Run the Web Time Server as a Daemon</h3>\n<p>In this last and final step I ask you to run the Web Time Server as a daemon, which means that it keeps running perpetually, even after you have logged out. Convince yourself that a program that keeps running, while not being attached to a terminal any more, needs to have both <code>stdout</code>&nbsp;and <code>stderr</code> redirected.</p>\n<p>One way to run the Web Time Server as a daemon is to use the command <code>nohup</code>, along with the complete command line that calls the Web Time Server. There is a catch, however. While <code>nohup</code> takes care of redirecting <code>stdout</code>&nbsp;for you, you will need to redirect <code>stderr</code> yourself. I ask you to redirect <code>stderr</code> into a file called <code>nohup.err</code>. Also, note that the server needs to be started in the background, otherwise the server will be terminated (even though you started it with <code>nohup</code>) when you log out. At this point you need to draw on your skills that you have acquired in the tools classes up to this point, so I expect that you understand what I just said.</p>\n<p>Go ahead and start up the Web Time Server as a daemon. Now watch out for the file that you redirected <code>stderr</code> into, i.e. <code>nohup.err</code>. <span style=\"color: #0000ff;\"><strong>Take a screenshot of the contents of that file [3].</strong></span>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Now log out of your system and hit the server with the browser on your local computer. Remember that the server name is that convoluted name that you find on your EC2 instance. <span style=\"color: #0000ff;\"><strong>Take a screenshot of the browser's location line and the server's proper response [4]. </strong></span>For me, that looks like this:</p>\n<p><img id=\"9389547\" src=\"https://canvas.nau.edu/courses/35850/files/10992798/preview?verifier=n8FB7PsKInY0KMC5WLvc3KUygpud5jfspbS5kbQK\" alt=\"wts.png\" width=\"476\" height=\"176\" data-api-endpoint=\"https://canvas.nau.edu/api/v1/courses/35850/files/10992798\" data-api-returntype=\"File\"></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #0000ff;\"><strong>Finally, I ask you to take a note of the link to your server, which you also need to submit. Make sure that the link works. The TA should be able to click on that link and verify that the server produces the correct result!

AI can be successfully used in this assignment as a smart teammate who listens to your ideas and gives good advice on how to proceed. The advice can be used as input to the work students do to generate a final assignment.</p>\n<p>Students should be aware of the potential limitations of using generative AI for design tasks as their focus is on language mainly, not modeling. Finally, in the context of databases, generative AI will bias the outcome toward relational models, which can result in violations of the ER model constraints. Use it wisely!</p>\n<p>Finally, Since generative AI will consider its generic knowledge base to produce its output, its insights can potentially violate the assignment specification. It is your job to critically evaluate the outputs of generative AI systems and make them aligned with the problem specification. ChatGPT (or any other AI tool really!) must be used as a support tool, not as an author of the work!</p>\n<p>Any final work submitted by students is expected to be generated by the students themselves, working individually or in groups as directed by class assignment instructions. Submitting final work created by generative AI constitutes an academic integrity violation.</p>\n<hr>\n<h2><strong><img id=\"1027787\" role=\"presentation\" src=\"https://canvas.nau.edu/courses/35859/files/11198365/preview?verifier=Y2facXxCPjMTtO4Ro0Ci2t6Jr5p4dggY54BkiaBC\" alt=\"\" width=\"45\" height=\"45\" data-api-endpoint=\"https://canvas.nau.edu/api/v1/courses/35859/files/11198365\" data-api-returntype=\"File\">Procedure</strong></h2>\n<p><span><strong>Step 1.&nbsp;</strong></span>Make a local copy of the <a class=\"instructure_file_link instructure_scribd_file inline_disabled\" title=\"Homework-1.docx\" href=\"https://canvas.nau.edu/courses/35859/files/11198426?verifier=U4kL3l478OMFsuKpSASxcbDVbe2VDkBQlaVgcbr8&amp;wrap=1\" target=\"_blank\" data-api-endpoint=\"https://canvas.nau.edu/api/v1/courses/35859/files/11198426\" data-api-returntype=\"File\">HW1 instructions file</a>.</p>\n<p><strong>Step 2.</strong> Follow the instructions in the file to fill in the provided tables.</p>\n<p><strong>Step 3.</strong> Save your file with the solution as <span style=\"color: #ba372a;\"><em>HW2_1_&lt;studentID&gt;.pdf</em></span> where <em>&lt;studentID&gt;</em> is your student ID number (only numbers, without the '<em>a</em>').</p>\n<p><strong>Step 4.</strong> Submit the .pdf file as your solution for this assignment.</p>\n<p><strong>Notes</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>This is an individual assignment; do not work with others.</li>\n<li>You may use class materials (including the textbook) for reference.</li>\n<li>The video below shows an example of how to fill the tables in this assignment.</li>\n</ul>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><iframe class=\"lti-embed\" style=\"width: 720px; height: 420px; display: inline-block;\" title=\"Homework 1 - Data Dictionary: How To\" src=\"https://canvas.nau.edu/courses/35859/external_tools/retrieve?display=borderless&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fnorthernarizona.instructuremedia.com%2Flti%2Flaunch%3Fcustom_arc_launch_type%3Dbare_embed%26custom_arc_media_id%3Dda2939a0-1d22-474b-b07b-979552ee1e22-589%26custom_arc_start_at%3D0\" width=\"720\" height=\"420\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"webkitallowfullscreen\" mozallowfullscreen=\"mozallowfullscreen\" allow=\"geolocation *; microphone *; camera *; midi *; encrypted-media *; autoplay *; clipboard-write *; display-capture *\" data-studio-resizable=\"true\" data-studio-tray-enabled=\"true\" data-studio-convertible-to-link=\"true\"></iframe></p>\n<h3><strong><img id=\"1027799\" role=\"presentation\" src=\"https://canvas.nau.edu/courses/35859/files/11198280/preview?verifier=7eoCROkLVHoRPTF9KJ9zZkP9ydXQTGN75AqPIDbv\" alt=\"\" width=\"45\" height=\"45\" data-api-endpoint=\"https://canvas.nau.edu/api/v1/courses/35859/files/11198280\" data-api-returntype=\"File\">Need help?</strong></h3>\n<p>Find assistance during <a title=\"0.3 | Teaching Assistants and Homework Support\" href=\"https://canvas.nau.edu/courses/35859/pages/0-dot-3-%7C-teaching-assistants-and-homework-support\" data-course-type=\"wikiPages\" data-published=\"true\" data-api-endpoint=\"https://canvas.nau.edu/api/v1/courses/35859/pages/0-dot-3-%257C-teaching-assistants-and-homework-support\" data-api-returntype=\"Page\">office hours</a>, <a title=\"0.5 | Live Sessions\" href=\"https://canvas.nau.edu/courses/35859/pages/0-dot-5-%7C-live-sessions\" data-api-endpoint=\"https://canvas.nau.edu/api/v1/courses/35859/pages/0-dot-5-%257C-live-sessions\" data-api-returntype=\"Page\">Live Sessions</a>, or in the Course's official communication tools (Canvas Messages and Canvas Discussions).</p>\n<hr>\n<h2><strong><img id=\"1027790\" role=\"presentation\" src=\"https://canvas.nau.edu/courses/35859/files/11198376/preview?verifier=vkmu4Y5DYK7DVvkm57mO7LRPb7wEtfNZpKhXIGvZ\" alt=\"\" width=\"45\" height=\"45\" data-api-endpoint=\"https://canvas.nau.edu/api/v1/courses/35859/files/11198376\" data-api-returntype=\"File\">Technical Support</strong></h2>\n<p><span>Need help using Canvas Assignments?

AI can be successfully used in this assignment as a smart teammate who listens to your ideas and gives good advice on how to proceed. This advice can be used as input to the work students do to generate a final assignment.</p>\n<p>Students should be aware of the potential limitations of using generative AI for design tasks as their focus is on language mainly, not modeling. Finally, in the context of databases, generative AI will bias the outcome toward relational models, which can result in violations of the ER model constraints. Use it wisely!</p>\n<p>Finally, Since generative AI will consider its generic knowledge base to produce its output, its insights can potentially violate the assignment specification. It is your job to critically evaluate the outputs of generative AI systems and make it aligned with the problem specification. ChatGPT (or any other AI tool really!) must be used as a support tool, not as an author of the work!</p>\n<p>Any final work submitted by students is expected to be generated by the students themselves, working individually or in groups as directed by class assignment instructions. Submitting final work created by generative AI constitutes an academic integrity violation.</p>\n<hr>\n<h2><strong><img id=\"1027787\" role=\"presentation\" src=\"https://canvas.nau.edu/courses/35859/files/11198365/preview?verifier=Y2facXxCPjMTtO4Ro0Ci2t6Jr5p4dggY54BkiaBC\" alt=\"\" width=\"45\" height=\"45\" data-api-endpoint=\"https://canvas.nau.edu/api/v1/courses/35859/files/11198365\" data-api-returntype=\"File\">Procedure</strong></h2>\n<p><span><strong>Step 1.&nbsp;</strong></span>Read the specification in the <a class=\"instructure_file_link instructure_scribd_file inline_disabled\" title=\"Homework-2.docx\" href=\"https://canvas.nau.edu/courses/35859/files/11198425?verifier=wYz5WFlCsCtOB5XvEvDhH4or3WOujz4vfKZsiz1w&amp;wrap=1\" target=\"_blank\" data-api-endpoint=\"https://canvas.nau.edu/api/v1/courses/35859/files/11198425\" data-api-returntype=\"File\">HW2 instructions file</a> carefully.</p>\n<p><strong>Step 2.</strong> Follow the instructions in the file and create an ER diagram for the problem below.</p>\n<p><strong>Step 3.</strong> Export the ER diagram as a PDF file named as <span style=\"color: #ba372a;\"><em>HW2_2_1_&lt;studentID&gt;.pdf</em></span> where <em>&lt;studentID&gt;</em> is your student ID number (only numbers, without the '<em>a</em>').</p>\n<p><strong>Step 4.</strong> Submit the .pdf file as your solution for this assignment.</p>\n<p><strong>Notes</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>This is an individual assignment; do not work with others.</li>\n<li>You may use class materials (including the textbook) for reference.</li>\n<li>You can draw the diagrams using the tool you are more familiar with, but I recommend <a class=\"inline_disabled\" href=\"https://app.diagrams.net/\" target=\"_blank\">Draw.io</a>.

The first goal is to store information about the cars that the clients bring in for fixing. About these cars, he needs to know the Vehicle Identification Number (VIN), the license plate, the make, the model, the color, and the year, so he could easily identify the car.</p>\n<p>Mr. Hook also needs to know who the car's owner is, which must be the client in the file. If somebody brings someone else's car for repair, they must have the owners name (first name and last name) and phone number to identify the client properly. Besides the name and phone number, Mr. Hook also needs to know the client's address, which includes the number and street name, apartment/unit number (optional), city, state, and zipcode. The system does not need to be prepared for international addresses (only USA). A client may bring more than one car to the shop. For safety reasons, Mr. Hook wants to store data about one or more authorized contacts, who are authorized to check out the car from the garage, in case the client can't be there. The required information are full name (first and last names) and phone number. In Mr. Hook's business, clients and authorized contacts are identified by a combination of their names and phone number.</p>\n<p>Clients can go to the garage shop for shopping car supplies only, in this case they don't have to have a car on the records. About the supplies, Mr. Hook needs to know the supplies unique ID, description, brand, cost price, sale price, and stock quantity for parts and supplies. Besides selling the supplies individually, Mr. Hook may also need to use car parts when repairing the vehicles. In this case, clients have 20% discount over the sale price.</p>\n<p>About the repairs, Mr. Hook needs to know the day in which the repair was completed and a description of the detected problem. For each repair, one or more procedures may be performed. About these procedures, Mr. Hook wants to store a procedure code (which Mr. Hook has created to facilitate the procedures' identification), the description of the procedure and the cost. Additionally, when a car's part or supply is used for a procedure during a repair, Mr. Hook wants to know which ones were used. The repair must have a total cost, which is calculated based on the cost of the parts and supplies, plus the price of the procedures.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><strong>Your diagram must contain:</strong></p>\n<p>Entities, Relationships, attributes, cardinalities, and participation indication.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Entities must be represented as Weak Entities if needed.</li>\n<li>Relationships must be represented as Identifying or ISA if needed.</li>\n<li>Attributes must be represented as primary key, derived, multi-valued, or composed if needed.</li>\n<li>Cardinalities must be represented with 1, N, or M only.</li>\n<li>Participation in relationships must be represented as total (double line) or partial (single line).</li>\n</ul>\n<h3><strong><img id=\"1027799\" role=\"presentation\" src=\"https://canvas.nau.edu/courses/35859/files/11198280/preview?verifier=7eoCROkLVHoRPTF9KJ9zZkP9ydXQTGN75AqPIDbv\" alt=\"\" width=\"45\" height=\"45\" data-api-endpoint=\"https://canvas.nau.edu/api/v1/courses/35859/files/11198280\" data-api-returntype=\"File\">Need help?</strong></h3>\n<p>Find assistance during <a title=\"0.3 | Teaching Assistants and Homework Support\" href=\"https://canvas.nau.edu/courses/35859/pages/0-dot-3-%7C-teaching-assistants-and-homework-support\" data-course-type=\"wikiPages\" data-published=\"true\" data-api-endpoint=\"https://canvas.nau.edu/api/v1/courses/35859/pages/0-dot-3-%257C-teaching-assistants-and-homework-support\" data-api-returntype=\"Page\">office hours</a>, <a title=\"0.5 | Live Sessions\" href=\"https://canvas.nau.edu/courses/35859/pages/0-dot-5-%7C-live-sessions\" data-api-endpoint=\"https://canvas.nau.edu/api/v1/courses/35859/pages/0-dot-5-%257C-live-sessions\" data-api-returntype=\"Page\">Live Sessions</a>, or in the Course's official communication tools (Canvas Messages and Canvas Discussions).</p>\n<hr>\n<h2><strong><img id=\"1027790\" role=\"presentation\" src=\"https://canvas.nau.edu/courses/35859/files/11198376/preview?verifier=vkmu4Y5DYK7DVvkm57mO7LRPb7wEtfNZpKhXIGvZ\" alt=\"\" width=\"45\" height=\"45\" data-api-endpoint=\"https://canvas.nau.edu/api/v1/courses/35859/files/11198376\" data-api-returntype=\"File\">Technical Support</strong></h2>\n<p><span>Need help using Canvas Assignments?

AI can be successfully used in this assignment as a smart teammate who listens to your ideas and gives good advice on how to proceed. This advice can be used as input to the work students do to generate a final assignment.</p>\n<p>Students should be aware of the potential limitations of using generative AI for design tasks as their focus is on language mainly, not modeling. Finally, in the context of databases, generative AI will bias the outcome toward relational models, which can result in violations of the ER model constraints. Use it wisely!</p>\n<p>Finally, Since generative AI will consider its generic knowledge base to produce its output, its insights can potentially violate the assignment specification. It is your job to critically evaluate the outputs of generative AI systems and make them aligned with the problem specification. ChatGPT (or any other AI tool really!) must be used as a support tool, not as an author of the work!</p>\n<p>Any final work submitted by students is expected to be generated by the students themselves, working individually or in groups as directed by class assignment instructions. Submitting final work created by generative AI constitutes an academic integrity violation.</p>\n<hr>\n<h2><strong><img id=\"1027787\" role=\"presentation\" src=\"https://canvas.nau.edu/courses/35859/files/11198365/preview?verifier=Y2facXxCPjMTtO4Ro0Ci2t6Jr5p4dggY54BkiaBC\" alt=\"\" width=\"45\" height=\"45\" data-api-endpoint=\"https://canvas.nau.edu/api/v1/courses/35859/files/11198365\" data-api-returntype=\"File\">Procedure</strong></h2>\n<p><span><strong>Step 1.&nbsp;</strong></span>Read the specification in the <a class=\"instructure_file_link instructure_scribd_file inline_disabled\" title=\"Homework-2.docx\" href=\"https://canvas.nau.edu/courses/35859/files/11198425?verifier=wYz5WFlCsCtOB5XvEvDhH4or3WOujz4vfKZsiz1w&amp;wrap=1\" target=\"_blank\" data-api-endpoint=\"https://canvas.nau.edu/api/v1/courses/35859/files/11198425\" data-api-returntype=\"File\">HW2 instructions file</a> carefully.</p>\n<p><strong>Step 2.</strong> Follow the instructions in the file and create an ER diagram for the problem below.</p>\n<p><strong>Step 3.</strong> Export the ER diagram as a PDF file named <span style=\"color: #ba372a;\"><em>HW2_2_2&lt;studentID&gt;.pdf</em></span> where <em>&lt;studentID&gt;</em> is your student ID number (only numbers, without the '<em>a</em>').</p>\n<p><strong>Step 4.</strong> Submit the .pdf file as your solution for this assignment.</p>\n<p><strong>Notes</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>This is an individual assignment; do not work with others.</li>\n<li>You may use class materials (including the textbook) for reference.</li>\n<li>You can draw the diagrams using the tool you are more familiar with, but I recommend <a class=\"inline_disabled\" href=\"https://app.diagrams.net/\" target=\"_blank\">Draw.io</a>.

A dentist in Mr. Hook's clinic is a person who has license number with the Arizona State Board of Dental Examiners. About dentists, Mr. Hook needs to know, in addition to the license, their name (first and last names), phone number, date of birth, and a list of specialties.</p>\n<p>Patients at Mr. Hook's clinic should be able to schedule appointments. An appointment has a date and a time of the day. In addition, it is necessary to know which dentist will see that patient at that time. Different dentists can have appointments at the same date and time, as long as they have different patients.</p>\n<p>Patients must be registered at the clinic to be treated. This registration is made on the date of the first appointment and it is available throughout the patient's life at the clinic. Mr. Hook needs to know a patient's full name (first, middle, last names), full address (street, apartment/unit, city, state, zipcode), phone number, date of birth, and gender identification. Patients have a unique patient ID.</p>\n<p>As the dentists at Mr. Hook's clinic have different specialties, a patient can schedule appointments with several dentists. For each appointment, in addition to the dentist in charge, it is necessary to know which procedures were performed. A procedure has a registration code, a price (determined by the Arizona State Board of Dental Examiners) and a brief description.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><strong>Your diagram must contain:</strong></p>\n<p>Entities, Relationships, attributes, cardinalities, and participation indication.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Entities must be represented as Weak Entities if needed.</li>\n<li>Relationships must be represented as Identifying or ISA if needed.</li>\n<li>Attributes must be represented as primary key, derived, multi-valued, or composed if needed.</li>\n<li>Cardinalities must be represented with 1, N, or M only.</li>\n<li>Participation in relationships must be represented as total (double line) or partial (single line).</li>\n</ul>\n<h3><strong><img id=\"1027799\" role=\"presentation\" src=\"https://canvas.nau.edu/courses/35859/files/11198280/preview?verifier=7eoCROkLVHoRPTF9KJ9zZkP9ydXQTGN75AqPIDbv\" alt=\"\" width=\"45\" height=\"45\" data-api-endpoint=\"https://canvas.nau.edu/api/v1/courses/35859/files/11198280\" data-api-returntype=\"File\">Need help?</strong></h3>\n<p>Find assistance during <a title=\"0.3 | Teaching Assistants and Homework Support\" href=\"https://canvas.nau.edu/courses/35859/pages/0-dot-3-%7C-teaching-assistants-and-homework-support\" data-course-type=\"wikiPages\" data-published=\"true\" data-api-endpoint=\"https://canvas.nau.edu/api/v1/courses/35859/pages/0-dot-3-%257C-teaching-assistants-and-homework-support\" data-api-returntype=\"Page\">office hours</a>, <a title=\"0.5 | Live Sessions\" href=\"https://canvas.nau.edu/courses/35859/pages/0-dot-5-%7C-live-sessions\" data-api-endpoint=\"https://canvas.nau.edu/api/v1/courses/35859/pages/0-dot-5-%257C-live-sessions\" data-api-returntype=\"Page\">Live Sessions</a>, or in the Course's official communication tools (Canvas Messages and Canvas Discussions).</p>\n<hr>\n<h2><strong><img id=\"1027790\" role=\"presentation\" src=\"https://canvas.nau.edu/courses/35859/files/11198376/preview?verifier=vkmu4Y5DYK7DVvkm57mO7LRPb7wEtfNZpKhXIGvZ\" alt=\"\" width=\"45\" height=\"45\" data-api-endpoint=\"https://canvas.nau.edu/api/v1/courses/35859/files/11198376\" data-api-returntype=\"File\">Technical Support</strong></h2>\n<p><span>Need help using Canvas Assignment?

AI can be successfully used in this assignment as a smart teammate who listens to your ideas and gives good advice on how to proceed. This advice can be used as input to the work students do to generate a final assignment.</p>\n<p>Students should be aware of the potential limitations of using generative AI for design tasks as their focus is on language mainly, not modeling. Finally, in the context of databases, generative AI will bias the outcome toward relational models, which can result in violations of the ER model constraints. Use it wisely!</p>\n<p>Finally, Since generative AI will consider its generic knowledge base to produce its output, its insights can potentially violate the assignment specification. It is your job to critically evaluate the outputs of generative AI systems and make them aligned with the problem specification. ChatGPT (or any other AI tool really!) must be used as a support tool, not as an author of the work!</p>\n<p>Any final work submitted by students is expected to be generated by the students themselves, working individually or in groups as directed by class assignment instructions. Submitting final work created by generative AI constitutes an academic integrity violation.</p>\n<hr>\n<h2><strong><img id=\"1027787\" role=\"presentation\" src=\"https://canvas.nau.edu/courses/35859/files/11198365/preview?verifier=Y2facXxCPjMTtO4Ro0Ci2t6Jr5p4dggY54BkiaBC\" alt=\"\" width=\"45\" height=\"45\" data-api-endpoint=\"https://canvas.nau.edu/api/v1/courses/35859/files/11198365\" data-api-returntype=\"File\">Procedure</strong></h2>\n<p><span><strong>Step 1.&nbsp;</strong></span>Read the specification in the <a class=\"instructure_file_link instructure_scribd_file inline_disabled\" title=\"Homework-2.docx\" href=\"https://canvas.nau.edu/courses/35859/files/11198425?verifier=wYz5WFlCsCtOB5XvEvDhH4or3WOujz4vfKZsiz1w&amp;wrap=1\" target=\"_blank\" data-api-endpoint=\"https://canvas.nau.edu/api/v1/courses/35859/files/11198425\" data-api-returntype=\"File\">HW2 instructions file</a> carefully.</p>\n<p><strong>Step 2.</strong> Follow the instructions in the file and create an ER diagram for the problem below.</p>\n<p><strong>Step 3.</strong> Export the ER diagram as a PDF file named <span style=\"color: #ba372a;\"><em>HW2_E_&lt;studentID&gt;.pdf</em></span> where <em>&lt;studentID&gt;</em> is your student ID number (only numbers, without the '<em>a</em>').</p>\n<p><strong>Step 4.</strong> Submit the .pdf file as your solution for this assignment.</p>\n<p><strong>Notes</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>This is an individual assignment; do not work with others.</li>\n<li>You may use class materials (including the textbook) for reference.</li>\n<li>You can draw the diagrams using the tool you are more familiar with, but I recommend <a class=\"inline_disabled\" href=\"https://app.diagrams.net/\" target=\"_blank\">Draw.io</a>.

He is responsible for purchasing and maintaining books and periodicals, which can be read and/or borrowed by registered users. The library serves 3 types of users: guest users, students, and teacher.</p>\n<p>For all the types of users, the library assigns a unique user number. Additionally, Mr. Hook needs to know their name (first and last names), age, and education level. Students must also inform which course they are taking, their student ID number, and the year of entry. Teachers must indicate their departments, a list of courses they teach and their degree. Guest users do not need to provide any additional information.</p>\n<p>Books and periodicals are both considered publications. A publication has a unique ISBN, a title, issue number, year, and number of available copies. Periodicals have the name of the organizers, subtitle (which registers the theme of that edition), volume and number. Books has a list of authors, publisher, and city.</p>\n<p>All the users can borrow or read books, but only read periodicals. Book loans are different for each type of user:<br>• &nbsp; &nbsp;Students: maximum of 4 books, for up to 14 days;<br>• &nbsp; &nbsp;Teachers: maximum of 10 books, for up to 180 days;<br>• &nbsp; &nbsp;Guests: maximum of up to 4 books for up to 7 days.</p>\n<p>When a user borrows a book, the checkout date, expected return date, and actual return date must be recorded. In case of delays to return the book, a fine must be calculated, in the amount of $1.00 per day of delay. Copies must be available for borrowing.</p>\n<p>Users can read any available publication. About a reading, Mr. Hook wants to know who is reading the publication, what publication they are reading and the date and time the user checked out and returned the publication to the returning tray.</p>\n<p>Teachers can request books for class research, which can no longer be borrowed, but only read at the library. When the teacher requests a book, Mr. Hook wants to know the date when the request was made and the expiration date.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><strong>Your diagram must contain:</strong></p>\n<p>Entities, Relationships, attributes, cardinalities, and participation indication.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Entities must be represented as Weak Entities if needed.</li>\n<li>Relationships must be represented as Identifying or ISA if needed.</li>\n<li>Attributes must be represented as primary key, derived, multi-valued, or composed if needed.</li>\n<li>Cardinalities must be represented with 1, N, or M only.</li>\n<li>Participation in relationships must be represented as total (double line) or partial (single line).</li>\n</ul>\n<h3><strong><img id=\"1027799\" role=\"presentation\" src=\"https://canvas.nau.edu/courses/35859/files/11198280/preview?verifier=7eoCROkLVHoRPTF9KJ9zZkP9ydXQTGN75AqPIDbv\" alt=\"\" width=\"45\" height=\"45\" data-api-endpoint=\"https://canvas.nau.edu/api/v1/courses/35859/files/11198280\" data-api-returntype=\"File\">Need help?</strong></h3>\n<p>Find assistance during <a title=\"0.3 | Teaching Assistants and Homework Support\" href=\"https://canvas.nau.edu/courses/35859/pages/0-dot-3-%7C-teaching-assistants-and-homework-support\" data-course-type=\"wikiPages\" data-published=\"true\" data-api-endpoint=\"https://canvas.nau.edu/api/v1/courses/35859/pages/0-dot-3-%257C-teaching-assistants-and-homework-support\" data-api-returntype=\"Page\">office hours</a>, <a title=\"0.5 | Live Sessions\" href=\"https://canvas.nau.edu/courses/35859/pages/0-dot-5-%7C-live-sessions\" data-api-endpoint=\"https://canvas.nau.edu/api/v1/courses/35859/pages/0-dot-5-%257C-live-sessions\" data-api-returntype=\"Page\">Live Sessions</a>, or in the Course's official communication tools (Canvas Messages and Canvas Discussions).</p>\n<hr>\n<h2><strong><img id=\"1027790\" role=\"presentation\" src=\"https://canvas.nau.edu/courses/35859/files/11198376/preview?verifier=vkmu4Y5DYK7DVvkm57mO7LRPb7wEtfNZpKhXIGvZ\" alt=\"\" width=\"45\" height=\"45\" data-api-endpoint=\"https://canvas.nau.edu/api/v1/courses/35859/files/11198376\" data-api-returntype=\"File\">Technical Support</strong></h2>\n<p><span>Need help using Canvas Assignment?

As the semester progresses, you will locate four big, beneficial things that occur and you will write about them. You will identify what these things (events, personal gains, big life changes, etc.) are and how they have shaped you as a person, student, and human. Always go for more detail over less.&nbsp;</span></li>\n<li aria-level=\"5\"><span>Expand on these with why you think they happened or what it is about them that truly made them stand out for you. You can always start by highlighting where you were in life before this happened, then explaining what happened and ending with where you have currently found yourself. Let this be almost like a journal if you need.&nbsp;</span></li>\n<li aria-level=\"5\"><span>You must be able to show how these have helped you to grow as well as why they are important to you. You must have 4 items in order to achieve full points on this assignment.&nbsp;</span></li>\n<li aria-level=\"5\"><span>Your four “things” you choose do NOT have to be school related, but you must be able to argue this to fit the requirements of the assignment.&nbsp;</span></li>\n<li aria-level=\"5\"><span>Each entry must be 3-5 pages minimum - if your submission is shorter than the 3-5&nbsp; page minimum then you will be docked. Each submission will be MLA format with headers and page numbers.&nbsp;</span></li>\n<li aria-level=\"5\"><span>This will be one document, holding all 4 items within it.
